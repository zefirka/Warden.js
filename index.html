      <h2>Concept</h2>
      <p>Warden.js is a library to make event-driven programming clean, declarative and easy.</p>
      <p>General idea of Warden.js that to make composing, combining and resolving concurrent events simpler. In mathematical sense, idea that to change your app's representation from tree of states to the partially ordered set of events in time (or other) priority relation. It means that in Warden.js events are data which change in time, not an actions which publish data to subsribers.</p>

      <h2>Rationale</h2>
      <ul id='rationale'>
        <li>
          <h3>Event-driven applications</h3>
          <p>Event-driven applications are hard. Hard to understand, hard to debug, hard to maintain. It's hard to combine values which can change over the time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Functioanl Reactive Programming</h3>
          <p>FRP is good solution. But there are troubles with it sometimes. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Trade-off</h3>
          <p>Warden.js - is a trade-off between FRP and traditional EDA. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why Warden?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>There are no dependencies with DOM, jQuery or other libraries or event emitting system in the Warden.js. You can use it on the front and on the back. With jQuery or with Node's Event Emiter or without anything.</li>
        <li>Simple declarative methods to combine, conjuncte and resolve concpetually connected events. Like sync or resolve. If your application turns to tangled web of simple events and you spoiling time to resolve synchronization, combining events in time and resolving problems - then Warden.js is for you.</li>
        <li>Pretty flexible API. There are no much of ready solutions, but there is way to add your own data stream processing method, combine methods and construct application in your way.</li>
        <li>It's not pure functional, but stay simple. In Warden you can create modules with dirty state, but if you're sure that these modules are simple and state is predictable. So after you can combine and reuse modules in more declarative way. It's not required to use pure functional programming technics from start to end while develop with Warden.</li>
        <li>It's lighweight. Current version (0.3.2): 15 KB (5.9 KB gzipped). And it comes with crossbrowser utilities package, modular package to create pipelines, dependency formulas from streams ...</li>
        <li>Low-level functional abstraction. You can write a bunch of cool things. An events sampler (for example).</li>

      <h3>Why not Warden?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Too early to use it in really large and demandig applications. Currently library is pretty raw. No community, no experience. If you are orienting to the secure, high performance, popular library or framework don't use Warden.js. But you can help us make it better!</li>
        <li>Weaky realization of F from FRP. If you are looking at ready solutions for pure functional in reactive way - check out Bacon, kefir, ProAct</li>
        <li>Low performance. In optimal usage it's faset than Bacon.js, but if you want to stay pure functional you could find that Warden is much more slower than Kefir, RxJS (sometimes it's a bit of slower than Bacon.js).</li>
        <li>Low-level functional abstraction. You should write a bunch of code to develop an events sampler (for example).</li>
